Valle:

✅Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.
✅exit with no options
✅Have a working history.
✅Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.
✅Handle ’ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence.
✅Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).

✅< should redirect input.
✅> should redirect output.
✅<< should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history!
✅>> should redirect output in append mode.

Matti:

✅cd with only a relative or absolute path
✅pwd with no options
✅export with no options
✅unset with no options
✅env with no options or arguments

✅Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which should expand to their values.
✅Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.

Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.

ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line. // blokkaa singnaalit!!!!!!!!!
ctrl-D exits the shell.
ctrl-\ does nothing.

✅echo with option -n

Evaluationform feiluja:

✅- echo "c.lol > tac | c.lol tac" luo tiedoston eika echota koko roskaa. (pipe sotkee)
- Single quotes ei pitäis vissiin muuttaa arvoa esim "echo '$USER'" pitäis printtaa "$USER"
	meillä printtaa environment valuen.

- export matti='homo'
- export testi =arvo
