==81983== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==81983== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,
==81983== or are doing some strange experiment):

==81983== 
==81983== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==81983==   /path/to/gdb ./minishell
==81983== and then give GDB the following command
==81983==   target remote | /Users/vvaalant/.brew/Cellar/valgrind/HEAD-7d4b46c/libexec/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=81983
